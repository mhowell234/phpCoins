Albert I|1 Belga|1930|1934|To make a distinction with the French Franc but especially in an effort to reduce the inflation, a new currency unit was introduced in 1926: the Belga. The Belga equalled 5 Francs. It appeared for the first time on coins in 1930. These coins of 1, 2 and 4 Belga, or 5, 10 and 20 Francs, are made from pure nickel.^^^^The 1 Belga coin was designed by Godfried Devreese (obverse) and Alexandre Everaerts (reverse). These coins were minted between 1930 and 1934.^^^^These coins were not at all popular among the Belgian population and were withdrawn from circulation quite rapidly. The 1 Belga coins were only withdrawn from circulation mid 1941 by the German occupier who needed metal. Many pieces however were kept behind and to resolve the money shortage after the Second World War these coins became legal tender again in September 1944.
