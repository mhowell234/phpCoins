Margrethe II|5 Kroner|1973|1988|This is a 5 Kroner coin depicting Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. Under her portrait is a heart which is the mint mark for Copenhagen, on the reverse is the royal crest. Queen Margrethe II is the 49th Danish monarch in a direct line of succession from King Harald Bluetooth, who united Denmark more than a thousand years ago.^^^^Margrethe is the eldest daughter of King Frederik IX and Queen Consort Ingrid of Sweden. Frederik and Ingrid had three daughters and no sons. According to Denmark's succession law (the Royal Ordinance of 1853), the throne could only be passed to a male thus the kings younger brother, Prince Knud, was heir presumptive. Unfortunately for Prince Knud, in 1953, an Act of Succession was passed which changed Denmark's secession from Sallic (or Agnatic) succession to Cognatic primogeniture (or male-preference primogeniture). This allows a female to succeed if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendents.
