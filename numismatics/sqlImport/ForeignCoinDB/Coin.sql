INSERT INTO Coin VALUES(1, "George V", 1, 1911, 1936, "The George V florin series, lasting throughout George V's reign from 1911 to 1936, features the Coat of Arms with 'Advance Australia' across the scroll, 'FLORIN' up the top of the reverse and the year of issue down the bottom. The obverse features the crowned bust of King George V facing to the left and the legend, GEORGIVS V D!!G!! BRITT : OMN : REX F!! D!! IND : IMP (George V, by the grace of god, Ruler and King of Britain, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India).

Like most George V series, this a very popular series to collect. In lower grade, all dates can be acquired at reasonable expense though the 1932 tends to start at around $200. Type set collectors would do well aiming for the 1925, 1927, 1928, 1931, 1935 and 1936 for good strikes at good value.

 This series was struck at the London, Heaton, Sydney and Melbourne mints. From 1911 to 1915 the London mint struck florin though in 1914 and 1915 the Heaton mint assisted with examples displaying the 'H' mintmark beneath the date. From 1916 to 1919 the Melbournemint struck florins bearing the mintmark 'M' under the date and from 1924 to 1926 the Melbourne mint in conjunction with the Sydney mint struck florins and the rest of the series was struck solely by the Melbourne mint.");

INSERT INTO Coin VALUES(2, "George VI", 1, 1938, 1952, "The George VI Florin was minted 1938-1952. 1938 saw a change in both the reverse and obverse design of the Australian Florin. With the new monarch, the obverse was designed depicting George VI without a crown as had been the tradition carried through from colonial times. The reverse coat of arms was redesigned with a more stylized kangaroo and emu incorporating a sprig of wattle in the design and each State's coat of arms.

Through the wartime years the Australian 2s was typically weakly struck. This was because less time was being taken in die preparation, the dies were being used longer in the production runs and less care was being taken with quality controls because of the pressing wartime issues. In 1946 after the war had ended the silver content of all Australian silver coins including the florin was reduced to help pay back the massive war debt incurred.

There are no known varieties of the George VI 2s. It was minted in Melbourne but those with an S mintmark were minted in San Francisco, USA. There are 2 pattern types 1937 and 1946. Of the 1946 pattern there are only 4 known examples the majority owned by the Melbourne museum. The obverse has 146 rim denticles.");

INSERT INTO Coin VALUES(3, "Leopold II", 4, 1865, 1878, "The 5 Francs was a crown sized silver coin issued from 1865 to 1878. The primary design used for the coin was to recognize the reigning monarch of that time period; King Leopold II.

Upon his Father’s death (Leopold I) on December 10, 1865, Leopold II would assume the monarchy as King of Belgium where he would remain until his death on December 17, 1909. At the time of Leopold’s reign he was classified as a constitutional monarch where the Belgium Parliament held all political decision making power.

Leopold’s greatest legacy was that as founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State or Belgian Congo. Leopold’s policies over the Congo State would be one of Africa’s darkest moments in history with his attempts of genocide of the peoples of Congo.");

INSERT INTO Coin VALUES(4, "Albert I", 5, 1930, 1934, "To make a distinction with the French Franc but especially in an effort to reduce the inflation, a new currency unit was introduced in 1926: the Belga. The Belga equalled 5 Francs. It appeared for the first time on coins in 1930. These coins of 1, 2 and 4 Belga, or 5, 10 and 20 Francs, are made from pure nickel.

The 1 Belga coin was designed by Godfried Devreese (obverse) and Alexandre Everaerts (reverse). These coins were minted between 1930 and 1934.

These coins were not at all popular among the Belgian population and were withdrawn from circulation quite rapidly. The 1 Belga coins were only withdrawn from circulation mid 1941 by the German occupier who needed metal. Many pieces however were kept behind and to resolve the money shortage after the Second World War these coins became legal tender again in September 1944.");

INSERT INTO Coin VALUES(5, "Margrethe II", 13, 1973, 1988, "This is a 5 Kroner coin depicting Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. Under her portrait is a heart which is the mint mark for Copenhagen, on the reverse is the royal crest. Queen Margrethe II is the 49th Danish monarch in a direct line of succession from King Harald Bluetooth, who united Denmark more than a thousand years ago.

Margrethe is the eldest daughter of King Frederik IX and Queen Consort Ingrid of Sweden. Frederik and Ingrid had three daughters and no sons. According to Denmark's succession law (the Royal Ordinance of 1853), the throne could only be passed to a male thus the kings younger brother, Prince Knud, was heir presumptive. Unfortunately for Prince Knud, in 1953, an Act of Succession was passed which changed Denmark's secession from Sallic (or Agnatic) succession to Cognatic primogeniture (or male-preference primogeniture). This allows a female to succeed if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendents.");

INSERT INTO Coin VALUES(6, "Sower", 16, 1970, 2001, "This Sower is a very familiar figure to the French: she was featured on the fifty centimes coin and on the one, two and five franc pieces until 2001, before appearing in a stylised version on the ten, twenty and fifty centime coins of the euro. She originally dates back to 1887. This was the year when Roty designed a prize medal commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture, but the project was not followed through. In 1896, when the Minister of Finance commissioned some new coins, Roty was one of the artists selected. He went back to the Sower of 1887 but transformed his robust peasant into a slim Marianne, wearing the Phrygian cap of Liberty. The traditional profile of the Republic was abandoned in favour of a more active, standing figure.

This model provoked violent debate. The newspapers railed against it: \"What is she sowing, this woman, with the fancy Phrygian cap? She is sowing disorder, anarchy, rye grass, hatred born of lies and immorality\" (Le Moniteur, 28 February 1897). The allegory, however, is clear. \"These seeds that she generously sows are the innumerable ideas that will germinate one day when we are no longer here.\" (La Liberté, 8 October 1898). The gesture is in fact more symbolic than realistic, because one does not broadcast seeds into the wind.");

INSERT INTO Coin VALUES(7, "George VI", 36, 1937, 1952, "George VI Half Crowns were struck from 1937 to 1952 (their are only two 1952 specimens known in existence as due to a nickel shortage none that year were meant to be struck). Their were three different types of Half Crown struck for George VI, the left facing portrait for all three types was by Thomas Humphrey Paget and the reverse for all three was by George Kruger Gray.

The first type was struck from 1937 to 1946, it was made of !!500 silver, it had a diameter of 32 millimetres and weighed approximately 14!!14 grams. The obverse inscription reads \"GEORGIVS VI D : G : BR : OMN : REX\". The reverse image is of a shield with the Royal Standard on it with a crown to its left and right both of which have interlocking G,s underneath them. The reverse inscription reads \"FID:DEF IND:IMP\" around the top of the coin and \"HALF CROWN\" followed by the date around the bottom of the coin.

The second type was struck in 1947 and 1948 it has exactly the same design as the first, the major difference is that the coin was debased which meant that due to silver rising in value the coin was made of a cupro nickel alloy and no longer had a silver content. The coin diameter remained the same but the weight increased to approximately 14!!22 grams.

The third design was struck from 1949 to 1952 the design its self is the same except \"IND:IMP\" (meaning Emporour of India) was removed from the reverse inscription as India had gained her independence.");

INSERT INTO Coin VALUES(8, "Franz Joseph I Standing", 49, 1907, 1908, "Hungarian 100 Korona gold bullion coins are identical in weight and purity to the Austrian 100 Coronas: however, the two gold bullion coins differ in designs. Whereas the Austrian gold bullion coins have a profile of Franz Joseph I on the obverse, the Hungarian 100 Koronas have him standing, holding a sphere and a scepter. The 100 Korona gold bullion coin reverse has the Hungarian Coat of Arms, a large shield held by winged angels.

Like the 100 Coronas, the Hungarian 100 Koronas are minted of 900 fine (21!!6 karat) gold, and each coin contains 0!!98 ounce of gold. The restrike date is 1908. (A restrike is an official reproduction of a coin that once was minted for circulation.) The edges are lettered with Bizalmam az osi erenyben.

Also like the 100 Coronas, Hungarian 100 Koronas are no longer minted and are among the lowest-premium gold bullion coins available. Hungarian 100 Koronas are less common than the Austrian 100 Coronas. Sometimes a few 100 Koronas will be included in an order of Austrian 100 Coronas. Dealers often do not distinguish between the two because they are essentially the same coin.");
