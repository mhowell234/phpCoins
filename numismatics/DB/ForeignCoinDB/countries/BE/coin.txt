Leopold II|5 Francs|1865|1878|The 5 Francs was a crown sized silver coin issued from 1865 to 1878. The primary design used for the coin was to recognize the reigning monarch of that time period; King Leopold II.^^^^Upon his Father’s death (Leopold I) on December 10, 1865, Leopold II would assume the monarchy as King of Belgium where he would remain until his death on December 17, 1909. At the time of Leopold’s reign he was classified as a constitutional monarch where the Belgium Parliament held all political decision making power.^^^^Leopold’s greatest legacy was that as founder and sole owner of the Congo Free State or Belgian Congo. Leopold’s policies over the Congo State would be one of Africa’s darkest moments in history with his attempts of genocide of the peoples of Congo.


Albert I|1 Belga|1930|1934|To make a distinction with the French Franc but especially in an effort to reduce the inflation, a new currency unit was introduced in 1926: the Belga. The Belga equalled 5 Francs. It appeared for the first time on coins in 1930. These coins of 1, 2 and 4 Belga, or 5, 10 and 20 Francs, are made from pure nickel.^^^^The 1 Belga coin was designed by Godfried Devreese (obverse) and Alexandre Everaerts (reverse). These coins were minted between 1930 and 1934.^^^^These coins were not at all popular among the Belgian population and were withdrawn from circulation quite rapidly. The 1 Belga coins were only withdrawn from circulation mid 1941 by the German occupier who needed metal. Many pieces however were kept behind and to resolve the money shortage after the Second World War these coins became legal tender again in September 1944.
