1 Belga|500|To make a distinction with the French Franc but especially in an effort to reduce the inflation, a new currency unit was introduced in 1926: the Belga. The Belga equalled 5 Francs. It appeared for the first time on coins in 1930. These coins of 1, 2 and 4 Belga, or 5, 10 and 20 Francs, are made from pure nickel.^^^^The piece of 4 Belga was designed by Armand Bonnetain (obverse) and Godfried Devreese (reverse). These coins were brought into circulation in 1931 and 1932. The coins of 100 year Belgian independence, or the 2 Belga coins, were designed by Armand Bonnetain. The obverse shows the three Belgian kings which Belgium had known to date. This coin came into circulation in 1930. The 1 Belga coin was designed by Godfried Devreese (obverse) and Alexandre Everaerts (reverse). These coins were minted between 1930 and 1934.^^^^These coins were not at all popular among the Belgian population and were withdrawn from circulation quite rapidly. The pieces of 2 and 4 Belga were already withdrawn from circulation in 1934. The 1 Belga coins were only withdrawn from circulation mid 1941 by the German occupier who needed metal. Many pieces however were kept behind and to resolve the money shortage after the Second World War these coins became legal tender again in September 1944. These coins were finally withdrawn from circulation in 1951.
