George V|Florin|1911|1936|The George V florin series, lasting throughout George V's reign from 1911 to 1936, features the Coat of Arms with 'Advance Australia' across the scroll, 'FLORIN' up the top of the reverse and the year of issue down the bottom. The obverse features the crowned bust of King George V facing to the left and the legend, GEORGIVS V D!!G!! BRITT : OMN : REX F!! D!! IND : IMP (George V, by the grace of god, Ruler and King of Britain, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India).^^^^Like most George V series, this a very popular series to collect. In lower grade, all dates can be acquired at reasonable expense though the 1932 tends to start at around $200. Type set collectors would do well aiming for the 1925, 1927, 1928, 1931, 1935 and 1936 for good strikes at good value.^^^^ This series was struck at the London, Heaton, Sydney and Melbourne mints. From 1911 to 1915 the London mint struck florin though in 1914 and 1915 the Heaton mint assisted with examples displaying the 'H' mintmark beneath the date. From 1916 to 1919 the Melbournemint struck florins bearing the mintmark 'M' under the date and from 1924 to 1926 the Melbourne mint in conjunction with the Sydney mint struck florins and the rest of the series was struck solely by the Melbourne mint. 

George VI|Florin|1938|1952|The George VI Florin was minted 1938-1952. 1938 saw a change in both the reverse and obverse design of the Australian Florin. With the new monarch, the obverse was designed depicting George VI without a crown as had been the tradition carried through from colonial times. The reverse coat of arms was redesigned with a more stylized kangaroo and emu incorporating a sprig of wattle in the design and each State's coat of arms.^^^^Through the wartime years the Australian 2s was typically weakly struck. This was because less time was being taken in die preparation, the dies were being used longer in the production runs and less care was being taken with quality controls because of the pressing wartime issues. In 1946 after the war had ended the silver content of all Australian silver coins including the florin was reduced to help pay back the massive war debt incurred.^^^^There are no known varieties of the George VI 2s. It was minted in Melbourne but those with an S mintmark were minted in San Francisco, USA. There are 2 pattern types 1937 and 1946. Of the 1946 pattern there are only 4 known examples the majority owned by the Melbourne museum. The obverse has 146 rim denticles.
