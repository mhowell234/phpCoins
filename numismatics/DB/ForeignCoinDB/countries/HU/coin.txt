Franz Joseph I Standing|100 Korona|1907|1908|Hungarian 100 Korona gold bullion coins are identical in weight and purity to the Austrian 100 Coronas: however, the two gold bullion coins differ in designs. Whereas the Austrian gold bullion coins have a profile of Franz Joseph I on the obverse, the Hungarian 100 Koronas have him standing, holding a sphere and a scepter. The 100 Korona gold bullion coin reverse has the Hungarian Coat of Arms, a large shield held by winged angels.^^^^Like the 100 Coronas, the Hungarian 100 Koronas are minted of 900 fine (21!!6 karat) gold, and each coin contains 0!!98 ounce of gold. The restrike date is 1908. (A restrike is an official reproduction of a coin that once was minted for circulation.) The edges are lettered with Bizalmam az osi erenyben.^^^^Also like the 100 Coronas, Hungarian 100 Koronas are no longer minted and are among the lowest-premium gold bullion coins available. Hungarian 100 Koronas are less common than the Austrian 100 Coronas. Sometimes a few 100 Koronas will be included in an order of Austrian 100 Coronas. Dealers often do not distinguish between the two because they are essentially the same coin.
